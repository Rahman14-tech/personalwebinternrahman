        , I attend several courses such as web programming, software
        engineering, and etc.<br></br> From it I was able to create a website
        using Laravel, uses Golang for the back end development, and <br></br>
        created a website using java spring boot as well. Beside that, I also
        attend some courses outside <br></br>of my university such as Harvard
        CS50 Web Development, Jetpack Compose Courses, and courses <br></br>from
        freecodecamp as well. From it, I was able to demonstrate and learn
        React, Django, jetpack<br></br> compose, and etc.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        Currently, I'm still unexperienced and looking for opportunity to join
        an internship as a Software <br></br>Engineer / Fullstack Developer.

        <br></br>I will be graduated from BINUS University in 2025 with a
        bachelor's degree in computer science.
